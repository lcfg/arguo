A rundown of ten causes a data project might fail. Summarised by London-based data scientist Martin Goodson, commenting on data projects' estimated duration when untested data is used ("add 6-12 months"), tortured team members ("six weeks to get permissions to install python") and potential adverse effects when managed by data novices ("it would [..] have killed people").

Key takeaways: define a clear goal before starting data projects, battle-hardened data is preferred, scientific methods are _required_ and never use "fantasy data", even for mock-ups.
